Getting Started
---------------

1. If you don't already have an Gumlet account then sign up at [gumlet.com](https://www.gumlet.com).

2. Create a [Web Folder](https://docs.gumlet.com/docs/configure-image-source) gumlet source with the `Base URL` set to your WordPress root URL (__without__ the `wp-content` part). For example, if your WordPress instance is at [http://example.com](http://example.com) and an example image is `http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/image.jpg` then your source's `Base URL` would be just `http://example.com/`.

3. [Download](https://github.com/gumlet/wordpress-plugin/releases) the gumlet WordPress plugin `gumlet_plugin.zip` and install on your WordPress instance. In the WordPress admin, click "Plugins" on the right and then "Add New". This will take you to a page to upload the `gumlet_plugin.zip` file. Alternatively, you can extract the contents of `gumlet_plugin.zip` into the `wp-content/plugins` directory of your WordPress instance.

4. Return to the "Plugins" page and ensure the "gumlet plugin" is activated. Once activated, click the "settings" link and populate the "Gumlet Host" field (e.g., `https://yourcompany.gumlet.io`). This is the full host of the gumlet source you created in step #1. Optionally, you can also turn on `Auto Format` or `Auto Compress`. Finally, click "Save Options" when you're done.

5. Go to a post on your WordPress blog and ensure your images are now serving through gumlet.
