Images make up more than 70% of your page weight. Optimizing images is the easiest way to improve page speed. A faster site leads to more engagement, sales and sign ups. Gumlet will help you INSTANTLY achieve maximum possible image optimization. This will also boost your image SEO.

This is an **install and forget about it** plugin. As soon as the plugin is installed all of the images on your site will be optimized. Gumlet does not touch your original images, they remain as it is. Our JavaScript detects the user device screen size and optimizes each image on the page in real time without any delay. All of this is done automatically, no manual settings required.

= WHY DO I NEED IMAGE OPTIMIZATION? =

### Fix your Google PageSpeed image opportunities
Is your Google PageSpeed performance test opportunities telling you to:

- Defer Offscreen Images
- Optimize Images
- Properly Size Images
- Serve images with correct dimensions
- Use WebP images
- Or, Serve Images in Next-Gen Formats

Test your website with [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com) or [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/). If they identify any image related issues like above, Gumlet will solve them.

Even if you are using another image optimization plugin, chances are they are not doing all of the possible optimization. Get a free image optimization report with our [analyzer tool](https://analyser.gumlet.com). We generally deliver 25-30% extra optimization over and above other plugins.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: How many images can I optimize for free? =
A: We have no cap on number of images that can be optimized through our plugin. You will be charged when your image delivery bandwidth exceeds 1 GB in a given month.

= Q: How can I remove the 1 GB limit? =
A: The limit is not hard enforced. When you cross the limit, we will send you invoice at the start of next month. Please pay it in 20 days and enjoy uninterrupted image delivery experience.

= Q: Does Gumlet delete or replace my original full-size images? =
A: Nope. Your original images always remain as they are and we never touch them. We only resize and compress images on-the-fly and cache it in our servers. You retain full control over your original images and they are never overwritten.

= Q: I’m a photographer, can I keep all my EXIF data? =
A: Yes! EXIF data stores camera settings, focal length, date, time and location information in image files. Since we never overwrite your original images, your all EXIF data will always be preserved. We only remove the EXIF data when we deliver images to your users.
